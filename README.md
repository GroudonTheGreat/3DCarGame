# 3DCarGame
First Award Winning project in PCCOE Comp.Dept. Mini Project Competition, Feb 2019

A simple car game demonstrating orthographic projections of a 3D world,
complete with proper keyboard input support and game loop logic.
There's no throttling (to limit framerate) used and will most probably use up one 
whole core of your machine, not exactly efficient...  But we had only 3 weeks 
to complete the project.

Didn't use github during development so, many intermediate and testing 
code files are scattered all over. 




## infBoost.cpp
contains the final code, cheers!
